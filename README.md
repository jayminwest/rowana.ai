Welcome to the Rowana project! This repository contains the source code for the Rowana website and potentially related tooling.

## Description

Without the right signals, LLMs might ignore your site or misrepresent your product. Don't let a confused AI bury your brand or become your unintended spokesperson.

Rowana is the build-time NPM tool that adds the structured data (like Schema.org) AI desperately needs to understand your product. No more hoping LLMs get it rightâ€”**make them get it right.**

This repository contains the landing page/website for Rowana. The core tool can be found at [rowana-ai/rowana-core](https://github.com/rowana-ai/rowana-core).

## Key Features (of the core tool)

*   **Accuracy:** Force AI to represent your product correctly.
*   **Control:** You built it, you define it. Take back control.
*   **Less Headache:** Set it up once, integrate it into your build, and forget about it.

## How Rowana Works (The Core Tool)

The following instructions are for using the core Rowana NPM package, which can be found at [rowana-ai/rowana-core](https://github.com/rowana-ai/rowana-core).

1.  **Install the package:** `npm install @rowana/core` (or `pnpm add @rowana/core`)
2.  **Set up your config:** Create a `rowana.config.js` (or similar) to define your organization, product details, etc. See the [core repository](https://github.com/rowana-ai/rowana-core) for configuration details.
3.  **Hook into your build:** Add `rowana generate` to your build script (e.g., `"build": "rowana generate && next build"`).

Rowana reads your config and generates the necessary structured data, injecting it into your site during the build process.
